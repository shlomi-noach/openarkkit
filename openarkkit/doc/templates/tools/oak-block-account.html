<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-block-account: block or release MySQL users accounts, disabling them or enabling them to login
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Disable the user web@webhost1.com from logging into MySQL:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --block --account-user=web --account-host=webhost1.com</blockquote>
Re-enable the user web@webhost1.com to log into MySQL:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --release --account-user=web --account-host=webhost1.com</blockquote>
Disable the user 'web' on any host from logging into MySQL:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --block --account-user=web</blockquote>
Disable the user 'web' on any host from logging into MySQL, and kill any existing connection for that user:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --block --account-user=web --kill</blockquote>
Same as above, provide connection parameters, prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -b --account-user=web</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-block-account --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf -b --account-user=web</blockquote>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
A long time missing functionality from MySQL is the ability to temporarily block connections for specific accounts, without changing their security privileges.
</p>

<p><i>oak-block-account</i> addresses this issue by utilizing the way MySQL passwords are stored. Essentially, to block an account, this tool changes the account's password into a blocked-password value in such way that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is impossible to log in to the account with the original password</li>
	<li>It is impossible to log in to the account with any other password</li>
	<li>It is possible to detect that the password is a blocked-password</li>
	<li>It is possible to recover the original password</li>
</ul>
<p>When a "release" action is requested, oak-block-account checks on the current password. If it identifies it as a blocked-password, it re institutes the original password.
In both cases the tool utilizes the SET PASSWORD command. The  required privilege is an UPDATE on the mysql.user table, usually reserved to the `root` user.
</p>

<p>Connections which are open at the time of executing <i>oak-block-account</i> are unaffected.
</p>

<p>
Either --block, --release or --list must be specified.
</p>
