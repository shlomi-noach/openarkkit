<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-kill-slow-queries: terminate long running queries
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Kill queries running longer than 60 seconds:
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --slow-query-seconds=60</blockquote>
Kill queries running longer than 60 seconds provided they're not invoked by user 'root':
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --slow-query-seconds=60 --skip-root</blockquote>
Kill queries running longer than 60 seconds provided they're not invoked by user 'myuser':
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --slow-query-seconds=60 --skip-user=myuser</blockquote>
Kill any query running longer than 60 seconds and which was invoked by user 'myuser'
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --slow-query-seconds=60 --filter-user=myuser</blockquote>
Same as above; doesn't perform the KILL, just prints out the statement:
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --slow-query-seconds=60 --filter-user=myuser --print-only</blockquote>
Same as above, short form; verbose:
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries -l 60 -f myuser --print-only -v</blockquote>
Same as above, provide connection parameters, prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -l 60 -f myuser</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-kill-slow-queries --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf -l 10 -f myuser</blockquote>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Terminate long running queries: this utility can terminate queries based on running time and invoking user. It utilizes MySQL's KILL QUERY command, which requires the SUPER privilege.

Queries can be terminated per given user, or can be skipped per given user. Only the queries get killed, the connections itself is not affected. Expect exceptions/errors on your client when the queries are killed.
