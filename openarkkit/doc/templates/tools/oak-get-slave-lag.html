<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-get-slave-lag: print slave replication lag and terminate with respective exit code.
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Print slave lag, return <b>0</b> exit code:
<blockquote>oak-get-slave-lag --user=root --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock</blockquote>
Print slave lag, return <b>1</b> exit code if slave lag is greater than <b>60</b> seconds or slave is not replicating at all. 
Return <b>0</b> exit code when slave replicates and lag is less than or equal to <b>60</b> seconds.
<blockquote>oak-get-slave-lag --user=root --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -e 60</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-get-slave-lag --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf -e 60</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This tools prints out the slave lag and produces either <b>0</b> exit code on success or <b>1</b> on failure</p>

<p>When the <b>--error-if-more-than-seconds</b> option (<b>-e</b> short form) is specified, <i>oak-get-slave-lag</i> expects
replication lag to be smaller than or equal to given value. If replication lags more than given number of seconds, or does not work
at all, the tool exits with <b>1</b> exit code. Otherwise the tool is satisfied and returns with <b>0</b> exit code.</p>

<p>Replication lag is deduced from the <b>Seconds_Behind_Master</b> value on <b>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</b>. Mind that this value is not always correct. 
Unless replication heartbeat is present (MySQL >= <b>5.5</b>), <b>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</b> may report a <b>0</b> lag when in fact it lags hours behind, 
for a limited period of time.</p>
