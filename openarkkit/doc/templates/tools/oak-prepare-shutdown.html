<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-prepare-shutdown: make for a fast and safe MySQL shutdown
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Prepare and shutdown the MySQL server:
<blockquote>oak-prepare-shutdown --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock && /etc/init.d/mysql stop</blockquote>
Prepare and shutdown the MySQL server, RedHat style:
<blockquote>oak-prepare-shutdown --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock && service mysql stop</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-prepare-shutdown --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf && service mysql stop</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This tools makes for a faster and safe shutdown process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It flushes InnoDB buffer pool pages until no further progress can be achieved for the duration of 10 consequent seconds</li>
	<li>When server acts as a slave, it gracefully stops replication while verifying no slave temporary tables remain open</li>
</ul>
<p>Flushing of InnoDB pages is performed by setting <strong>innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct</strong> to <strong>0</strong>. InnoDB follows by attempting to reach that
target. On an active server, it will most probably never reach <strong>0</strong>. <i>oak-prepare-shutdown</i> follows up on the rate of page flush, and terminates 
when it concludes no more gain is expected.</p>

<p>Interrupting this tool with Ctrl-C results with restoring original settings and termination with error.</p>

<p>Any abnormal termination of this tools results with <strong>innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct</strong> still being set to <strong>0</strong>. 
This may seriously degrade the performance of your running database. Make sure to manually restore to original settings, e.g. via:</p>
<blockquote>mysql&gt; SET GLOBAL innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 90;</blockquote>
