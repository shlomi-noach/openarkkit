<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-modify-charset: change the character set (and collation) of a textual column.
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Change the character set of the Name column of the world.City table to utf8 (apply default collation):
<blockquote>oak-modify-charset world.City.Name utf8</blockquote>
Change the character set of the Name column of the world.City table  to utf8 and specify the collation:
<blockquote>oak-modify-charset world.City.Name utf8 utf8_bin</blockquote>
Same as above, do not actually perform the ALTER, just print it to standard output.
<blockquote>oak-modify-charset --print-only world.City.Name utf8 utf8_bin</blockquote>
As above, provide connection parameters, prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-modify-charset --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock world.City.Name utf8 utf8_bin</blockquote>
As above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-modify-charset --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf world.City.Name utf8 utf8_bin</blockquote>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
oak-modify-charset enables a safe way to convert a column's character set, while retaining its other properties, such as its NULLability or default value. It uses ALTER TABLE to achieve this, and you must have the ALTER privilege on the given table to do so (usually reserved to user 'root').

The tool verifies that the column is indeed of textual type (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT and variances), otherwise it reports an error.

With --print-only, nothing is actually performed: instead, the ALTER TABLE statement is printed to standard output.
